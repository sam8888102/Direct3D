## ðŸ§° Installation
To get started with Direct3D, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Direct3D.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained models and necessary datasets.

## ðŸ“˜ Usage
1. **Training:** To train the Direct3D model, run:
```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --batch_size 16 --epochs 50
```

2. **Inference:** Generate 3D models from images using a pre-trained Direct3D model:
```bash
python inference.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --model_path /path/to/model.pth
```

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the Direct3D model on a test dataset:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset_path /path/to/test_dataset --model_path /path/to/model.pth
```
